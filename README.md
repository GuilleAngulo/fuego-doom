# Doom Fire
An implementation of the Doom fire effect described by Filipe Deschamps. As an addition to the original project, it is implemented to change wind effect direction on fire while moving the mouse over the div. If the cursor is outside the fire, it will stand straigth, but if you pass it over the fire canvas it will move left or right depending on the half side.
